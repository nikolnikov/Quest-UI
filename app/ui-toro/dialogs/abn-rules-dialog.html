      Medicare will only pay for services that it determines to be reasonable and necessary under section 1862 (a) (1) of the Medicare Law. If Medicare determines that a particular service, although it would otherwise be covered, is not reasonable and necessary under the Medicare Program standards, Medicare will deny payment for that service.<br><br>
      
      Explain to the patient that tests ordered by his/her physician and identified on this requisition with the following symbols are likely to be denied for payment for the reason(s) indicated:
      
      <ul>
          <li>@ = May not be covered for the reported condition</li>
          <li>F = Has prescribed frequency rules for coverage</li>
          <li>&amp; = A test or service performed with research/experimental kit</li>
          <li>B = Has both diagnosis and frequency-related coverage limitations</li>
      </ul>
      
      Details regarding National frequency limitations are included in the National Coverage Determinations available on the CMS Website at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/coverage/labindexlist.asp.<br><br>
      
      For the covered screening services, the National Medicare Frequency guidelines are as follows:
      
      <ul>
          <li>Occult Blood, PSA and High Risk Pap Smear - once every 12 months</li>
          <li>Non-High Risk Pap Smear - once every 24 months</li>
      </ul>
      
      After the ABN has printed, ensure the patient has read and understands the form. Notify the patient that, by signing the ABN, he/she is confirming their agreement to assume financial responsibility for the payment of these tests if they are denied by Medicare.
